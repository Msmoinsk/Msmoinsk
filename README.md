You've got the general idea right, but let's clarify and streamline the workflow:

1. **Docker Container**: Docker does not create a separate virtual OS for each container. Instead, Docker uses containers to package an application and its dependencies into a single unit that runs consistently across different environments. Containers share the host system’s OS kernel but run in isolated user spaces.

2. **Development and Sharing**:
   - **Creating a Container**: Developers create a Docker image, which is a blueprint for a container. This image includes the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies required to run the application.
   - **Running the Container**: From this image, Docker creates a container, which is a running instance of the image. The container executes the application in isolation from other applications.

3. **Collaborative Development**:
   - Developers can share Docker images by pushing them to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub). Other developers can then pull these images and run them on their local machines or other environments.

4. **Deployment on EC2**:
   - **EC2 Instance**: Amazon EC2 provides virtual machines (instances) in the cloud. Each EC2 instance runs its own OS and can run Docker.
   - **Running Docker on EC2**: Once Docker is installed on an EC2 instance, you can deploy Docker containers on that instance. The Docker container runs your application, isolated from other applications on the same EC2 instance.

### Workflow Summary

1. **Develop and Build**:
   - **Create a Docker Image**: Develop your application (e.g., Node.js app) and package it into a Docker image.
   - **Run Locally**: Developers can run this Docker image locally, ensuring that the application behaves consistently across different development environments.

2. **Share and Collaborate**:
   - **Push Image to Registry**: Push the Docker image to a Docker registry.
   - **Pull Image**: Other developers or deployment systems can pull this image from the registry.

3. **Deploy on EC2**:
   - **Launch EC2 Instance**: Start an EC2 instance with a suitable OS.
   - **Install Docker**: Install Docker on the EC2 instance.
   - **Run Docker Container**: Pull the Docker image from the registry and run it as a container on the EC2 instance.

### Diagram for Clarity

Here’s a simplified diagram to illustrate this process:
